   - Fear periods: 72.7% of trades, lower profitability
   - Suggests over-trading during market stress
   - **Implication**: Focus on trade quality over quantity

3. **🎯 Neutral Period Anomaly**
   - Surprisingly lowest win rates at 31.7%
   - **Insight**: Market indecision may be the worst condition for trading

### 🧠 **Behavioral Economics Insights**

- **Risk Perception**: Larger average trade sizes during Fear periods despite lower profitability

## 🎯 Actionable Recommendations

### 🏆 **Tier 1 Strategies** (Immediate Implementation)

1. **📊 Dynamic Position Sizing**
   ```
   Greed Periods: ↑ Increase position sizes (higher probability)

   ```

2. **⏰ Market Timing Framework**
   - **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on best setups during Greed
   - **Capital Preservation**: Avoid over-trading during Fear
   - **Preparation Phase**: Use Neutral periods for research/analysis

3. **📈 Performance Monitoring**
